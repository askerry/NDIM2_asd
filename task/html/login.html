<h3>Thank you for participating in our research!</h3>
<p class="emph">Instructions</p>
<p>In this study, you will be reading short passages about a character. For each passage, you will be asked to make a number of simple judgments about that passage (the passage will be shown for each question, so that you may reread if needed). There is no right or wrong answer (some of the questions might even seem a little strange!), we are just interested in your opinion.</p>
<p>There will be totaldimnum_var questions about each passage, and a total of totalitemnum_var passages. Answering the questions about a passage should take less than 5 minutes. At the end of each passage you will be asked if you'd like to take a break and return to the task later, or continue with the next passage. If you do need to take breaks, please take them in between rounds when prompted (you can save and logout if needed) rather than taking breaks in the middle of the rounds. </p>   
<p>Please progress through the survey without returning to previous questions. We are interested in your initial hunch, so there is no need to change your answers. Please avoid using the "previous page" button in your browser, as this may cause problems with the recording of your responses.</p>
<p>The data collected from this study will be used as part of a scientific research project. It is part of the study you participated in at MIT, but your decision to complete this part of the study is optional. Your data may be used in analyses presented at scientific meetings or published in scientific journals. Continuing with this study indicates that you agree to complete this study voluntarily.</p>
<p>If you and are ready to begin, please fill in your Subject ID (provided via email) and click below. By continuing, you are providing consent to participate in this study. </p>
